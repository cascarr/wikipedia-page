# wikipedia-page
A basic Wikipedia clone project to demonstrate my HTML skills.
This project was greatly inspired by the Wikipedia page
project on the devpractical.com site https://devpractical.com/html-project-wikipedia/
80% of this project has carefully followed the project requirement listed on the above website. However, in the future I still intended to make further updates as this is just the basic HTML version of this project.
Skills demonstrated in this project are as follows:
Adding different types of text like headings, paragraphs, lists, and superscript to the webpage.
Adding a table of content containing page jump links to content within the page.
Git operational skills and Linux command.
